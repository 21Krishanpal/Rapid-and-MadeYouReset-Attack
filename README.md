# Rapid and MadeYou Reset Attack

Rapid and MadeYouReset script is a testing tool for the Rapid/MadeYouReset DDoS attack. It uses a minimal HTTP/2 client that connects over TLS, skips certificate checks, and sends rapid HEADERS and RST_STREAM frames to check if a server is vulnerable. 

## Prerequisites

- [Go](https://golang.org/dl/)
- [Python](https://www.python.org/)

Tested on go1.21.3/Python3 on arm64.  

## Installation

### Clone the Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/21Krishanpal/Rapid-and-MadeYouReset-Attack.git
```

### Installing

```
cd rapidresetclient
chmod +x rapid.sh
./rapid.sh

### Flags

- `requests`: Number of requests to send.

- `url`: Server URL (`https://example.com:443`).

- `wait`: Wait time in milliseconds between starting workers.

- `delay`: Delay in milliseconds between sending HEADERS and RST_STREAM frames.

- `concurrency`: Maximum number of concurrent workers.

### Example

Send 20 HTTP/2 requests (HEADERS and RST_STREAM frames) over a single connection to https://example.com using 5 workers, a 10 ms delay between sending HEADERS and RST_STREAM frames, and a wait time of 100 ms between each invocation.

### Impact of Rapid Reset / MadeYouReset Vulnerability
#### Business Disruption (Denial of Service):
- These vulnerabilities allow attackers to launch highly efficient Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks against web applications and APIs.
- Even a small number of malicious requests can overwhelm servers, leading to downtime of customer-facing applications, portals, or online services.
#### Financial Impact:
- **Direct costs**: additional cloud/CDN bandwidth, emergency mitigation, or acquiring DDoS protection services.
- Large-scale DDoS incidents can cause millions in losses per day for service-driven organizations.

### Key Message for Management
 - This is not just a technical issue - itâ€™s a business continuity and reputational risk.

 - Organizations need to ensure patching, DDoS mitigation strategies, and monitoring are in place to prevent service disruption.

 - Proactive defense (cloud-based DDoS protection, WAF, HTTP/2 patching) is cheaper and less damaging than handling an outage after the fact.
